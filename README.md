# Get Rich
TLDR; Some boilerplate for SaaS brandds/marketing websites using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/).

To get started, click `Use this template` on the top of this current page. After getting it on your machine, run `npm i` then use `npm start` to run the project locally. This project is currently using a beta version of [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Better documentation is coming as I continue to build this out.

`!! Work is in progress !!`

This approach is purposefully simple. After working on a handful of SaaS marketing websites, it seems the biggest hang-up is adding complexity for non-technical, "back-end" users to interact with the code. Here, my hope is that the code is simple enough for anyone on the team to work with. More to come, but I hope to build docs to help any team member get up to speed here.
