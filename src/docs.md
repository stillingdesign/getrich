# Get started with Getrich

<p class="intro">Getrich is opinionated boilerplate for your SaaS brand. Bypass the basics and start growing your business.</p>

## Use the template

Rather than install some shit with NPM, Getrich was built as a templateâ€”meaning once you use it, it is all yours.

Now, that means **you won't be able to update with a simple** `npm update`, and that's just fine. Mostly, this is just a hunk of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
